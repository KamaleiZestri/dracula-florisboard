## Install

All instructions can be found at [draculatheme.com/florisboard](https://draculatheme.com/florisboard).

### Note
FlorisBoard v0.3.14 onwards uses a new theming system so any older version should use the ([legacy](https://github.com/dracula/florisboard/tree/0.3.14)) install.

## Colours
We use the Dracula colours in our theme, however some are modified to be lighter when a key is pressed.
For example, #6272a4 becomes #7184bc when pressed. For future reference, the lightness value of the colour is increased by 10.
